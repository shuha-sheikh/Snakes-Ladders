# Snakes-Ladders

I created the program using a template provided by my teacher that was jumbled and had pieces missing.

This is a Ruby program that runs a Snake & Ladders game against the computer.
All dice rolls are random and there is no strategy.
The user must input Y or N to indicate whether they would like the game to continue or terminate.
